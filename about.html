                        We are a family owned & operated business. We have been in business for over 30 years and
                        operate out of our brick and mortar shop in Brighton Michigan. Our staff has over 80 years
                        combined experience and love what we do. The shop is owned by a father and son team, Patrick and
                        Jason Bane. Our family has lived in the Brighton/Brighton community for more than 80 years. We
                        have been active in several community organizations from church events to local Jaycees and
                        Charities. We are safe, honest and trusted online and in our community ( Just ask around! ). I
                        decided to open The Coin Shop India after years of doing business from my home. My dad was also
                        doing business from his home. We were found online and customers were able to call and make an
                        appointment with us. Everything was going fine until my dad was robbed. The thieves didn’t do
                        any harm, but they did manage to get away with several thousands of dollars. Safety is my number
                        one concern. It’s one thing to do something you love, it’s another thing to get injured or worse
                        doing it. After that I persuaded him to stop doing business in his home and I took some time to
                        re-group. After almost 3 years of planning and saving, I opened The Coin Shop. My dad has been
                        retired for years now and I was worried about his health and safety. Opening the shop allowed
                        him to do something he loves and have a safe environment to do it in. We love coming to work
                        everyday
                        and interacting with our customers who share the same passion for coins that we do.
                        Online Coin Sales After years of selling on ebay we have decided to offer coins and bullion on
                        our own site.
                        The site is devoted to offering you the best deals available online. We are able to sell at
                        lower prices because we are no longer paying 1000’s of INR in ebay fees. Stronger Together We
                        have partnered with AMARK located in California & Las Vegas.
                        AMARK is one of the largest distributers in the United States for bullion products. This
                        partnership allows us to sell a very wide variety of bullion at very near wholesale </li>
